== Overview

This repository contains sample projects and documentation related to Ncache, a powerful caching solution for Java applications. Ncache is an essential component for enhancing the performance, scalability, and reliability of Java applications, especially in distributed environments. This README will provide an overview of Ncache and introduce the available sample project in this repository.

Ncache is a distributed, in-memory caching solution that allows Java applications to efficiently manage and store data in-memory. It serves as a high-performance data storage and retrieval mechanism, significantly improving the response times of your applications. Ncache is particularly beneficial for Java applications because it enables:

* Scalability: Ncache can seamlessly scale out to accommodate growing workloads, ensuring that your Java applications can handle increased traffic without performance degradation.

* Data Caching: By storing frequently accessed data in-memory, Ncache minimizes the need to query databases repeatedly, resulting in faster data access and reduced latency.

* High Availability: Ncache provides data replication and clustering capabilities, ensuring that your Java applications remain available even in the face of node failures.

* Data Consistency: Ncache offers support for data caching patterns like Cache-Aside and Cache-Through, maintaining data consistency between the cache and data sources.

* Integration: Ncache seamlessly integrates with various Java technologies, making it easy to incorporate into your existing applications.

== Sample Projects

This repository hosts a collection of sample projects that demonstrate how to integrate Ncache with Java applications. Currently, there is one sample project available:

* link:01-hello-world/[01 Hello World]: A simple Java application that serves as a "Hello World" introduction to connecting to Ncache. This project provides a basic example of setting up Ncache within a Java application and performing some simple caching operations. It is an excellent starting point for developers looking to get acquainted with Ncache integration in Java applications.

=== Getting Started
